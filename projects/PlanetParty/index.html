																												<p>When the player grabs an item, their hand should be placed correctly on the item, a bowling ball isn't grabbed the same way a cocktail glass is grabbed! I implemented a system to pick the correct hand pose based on the item and where the item has been grabbed.</p>\
																												<p>On grabbable items static mesh, we could add one or more socket with a specific nomenclature and the item itself has a dictionary that associate the socket name with a hand pose. When a player grabs an item, the hand checks if there is one of these sockets and pick the closest one. Based on the socket name, the hand select the correct pose set in the item dictionary.</p>", "right");
