Then Jenkins send a message to a dedicated Discord channel to notify users of the build result with a link to the build logs.</p>", "right");

																												<p>Besides of the game development, we needed to get data from the game exploitation such as: How many games have been run? With how many players? In which level they are? etc...</p>\
                                                        <p>To achieve this, the games communicate with a PHP script to add or update data. If, for any reason, the request can't reach the server where is the PHP script, the request is saved to be sent later.</p>\
